# TKN Deployment and Scaling Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive scaling strategy for TKN (Token) system deployments, based on realistic combinatorial analysis of English language patterns and empirical corpus statistics. Unlike traditional tokenizers, TKN's unique architecture requires careful consideration of both token storage and relationship management at scale.

## Combinatorial Analysis: English Language Baseline

### Theoretical Foundation

TKN's scaling behavior can be modeled using English language corpus statistics as a baseline. Empirical research shows that unique token growth follows Zipf's law, creating predictable scaling patterns.

**English Language Corpus Statistics:**

```
Corpus Size    Traditional Words    Unique Token Growth Rate
1M tokens      50K words           ~√(corpus_size) × 50
10M tokens     100K words          Growth rate slows
100M tokens    300K words          Plateau begins
1B tokens      1M words            ~√(corpus_size) × 1000
10B tokens     2M words            Near plateau (Zipf's law)
```

### TKN-Specific Scaling Models

TKN discovers subword patterns through inclusion heuristics, leading to different scaling characteristics than whole-word tokenization.

#### Node Count (Unique Tokens)

TKN's adaptive pattern discovery creates more granular tokens than traditional approaches:

```
Corpus Size    Traditional Words    TKN Estimated Tokens    Factor
1M            50K                  75K                     1.5x
10M           100K                 200K                    2.0x
100M          300K                 600K                    2.0x
1B            1M                   1.5M                    1.5x
10B           2M                   2.5M                    1.25x
```

**Mathematical Model:**

- Small corpora (1M-100M): `unique_tokens ≈ corpus_size^0.6 × 2`
- Large corpora (1B+): `unique_tokens ≈ corpus_size^0.5 × 1.5`

#### Edge Count (Token Relationships)

Every consecutive token pair creates a potential relationship. The key insight is that unique relationships scale differently than raw pairs due to pattern repetition.

**Raw vs. Unique Edges:**

```
Corpus Size    Raw Consecutive     Unique Relationships    Compression Potential
               Pairs               (Empirical ~N^0.75)
1M            1M                  200K                    5:1
10M           10M                 3M                      3.3:1
100M          100M                25M                     4:1
1B            1B                  200M                    5:1
10B           10B                 1.5B                    6.7:1
```

**Mathematical Model:**
`unique_edges ≈ corpus_size^0.75` for English-like text patterns

## Memory Requirements Analysis

### Memgraph Storage Formula

Based on Memgraph's documented memory usage:

- **Nodes**: 212 bytes per vertex (includes vertex, delta, skiplist overhead)
- **Edges**: 162 bytes per edge (includes edge, delta, skiplist overhead)

### Conservative Scaling Model

**Memory requirements with adaptive compression:**

```
Corpus     Unique    Compressed    Node        Edge        Total       Per-Token
Size       Tokens    Edges        Memory      Memory      Memory      Overhead
1M         75K       100K         16 MB       16 MB       32 MB       32 bytes
10M        200K      1.5M         42 MB       243 MB      285 MB      29 bytes
100M       600K      12M          127 MB      1.9 GB      2.0 GB      20 bytes
1B         1.5M      100M         318 MB      16 GB       16.3 GB     16 bytes
10B        2.5M      750M         530 MB      121 GB      122 GB      12 bytes
```

**Key Observations:**

1. **Memory scaling is edge-dominated** (edges are 98%+ of memory usage at scale)
2. **Per-token overhead decreases** with corpus size due to pattern reuse
3. **Adaptive compression is essential** - without it, memory requirements double

## Multi-Tenant Capacity Planning

```

### Deployment Architecture Recommendations

- **Target**: <1B token corpora
- **Hardware**: 512GB-1TB RAM instances
- **Tenant density**: 30-250 per instance

#### Tier 2: Dedicated Multi-Tenant (Large Customers)

- **Target**: 1B-10B token corpora
- **Hardware**: 1TB+ RAM instances
- **Tenant density**: 4-8 per instance
- **Economics**: Premium pricing, dedicated resources

#### Tier 3: Hyperscale Dedicated (Enterprise)

- **Target**: 10B+ token corpora
- **Hardware**: Multi-instance clusters or on-disk storage
- **Tenant density**: 1 per instance/cluster
- **Economics**: Enterprise pricing, custom deployment

## Adaptive Compression Strategy Integration

### Compression Effectiveness by Scale

The adaptive compression strategy becomes more effective at larger scales due to increased pattern repetition:

```
Corpus Size    Raw Edges    Compression Ratio    Storage Efficiency
1M            1M           5:1                   80% reduction
10M           10M          6.7:1                 85% reduction
100M          100M         8:1                   87.5% reduction
1B            1B           10:1                  90% reduction
10B           10B          13.3:1                92.5% reduction
```

**Mathematical Model:**
`compression_ratio ≈ log(corpus_size) × 2` for statistical patterns at scale

### Hub Token Distribution

High-frequency tokens (hubs) follow Zipf's law distribution:

- **Top 1% of tokens**: 50-60% of all relationships
- **Top 10% of tokens**: 80-85% of all relationships
- **Long tail**: 90% of unique tokens create <20% of relationships

This distribution makes adaptive compression highly effective, as the most frequent patterns become statistically predictable at scale.

## Resource Planning Guidelines

### Memory Allocation Strategy

**Reserved for system overhead:**

- **Base Memgraph instance**: 75-100 MB
- **Query execution buffer**: 2x graph memory (safety margin)
- **OS and monitoring**: 10-15% of total RAM

**Effective capacity calculation:**

```
Available Memory = Total RAM × 0.85 - Query Buffer
Query Buffer = Graph Memory × 2
Therefore: Available Memory = Total RAM × 0.85 - (Graph Memory × 2)
```

### Performance Considerations

**NVIDIA cuGraph Integration Benefits:**

- **GPU-accelerated PageRank**: 10-100x faster confidence scoring
- **Parallel community detection**: Essential for large-scale pattern analysis
- **Memory efficiency**: GPU memory supplements RAM for algorithm execution

**Recommended GPU configurations:**

- **Small-Medium tenants**: RTX 4090 or A5000 (24GB VRAM)
- **Large tenants**: A100 or H100 (80GB VRAM)
- **Hyperscale**: Multi-GPU configurations

## Economic Model

### Revenue Optimization

**Pricing tiers based on corpus size:**

```
Tier          Corpus Size     Monthly Price    Gross Margin    Tenants/Server
Starter       <100M tokens    $500-1K         85%             250
Professional  100M-1B tokens  $2K-5K          75%             30-60
Enterprise    1B-10B tokens   $10K-25K        65%             4-8
Hyperscale    10B+ tokens     $50K+           55%             1
```

**Infrastructure costs:**

- **512GB server**: ~$2K/month (cloud) or $50K capex
- **1TB server**: ~$4K/month (cloud) or $100K capex
- **GPU acceleration**: +50-100% infrastructure cost, +200-500% performance

### Break-even Analysis

**Multi-tenant economics make sense when:**

- **Tenant density** > 10 per server (shared costs)
- **Average tenant revenue** > $1K/month
- **Compression ratio** > 5:1 (memory efficiency)
- **Utilization rate** > 60% (resource optimization)

## Conclusion

The combinatorial analysis reveals that TKN's scaling characteristics are highly favorable for multi-tenant deployments. With proper adaptive compression and tier-based architecture, TKN can serve hundreds of tenants per server while maintaining performance and cost efficiency.

The key insight is that **edge relationships, not unique tokens, drive memory requirements**, and these relationships compress predictably based on English language statistics. This creates a sustainable economic model for TKN deployments from startup to hyperscale.

**Success factors:**

1. **Implement adaptive compression early** - it's essential for economic viability
2. **Use tier-based deployment strategy** - different customer segments need different approaches
3. **Leverage GPU acceleration** - transforms economics of large-scale deployments
4. **Monitor compression effectiveness** - it's the key to scalability

The mathematics show that TKN can achieve both technical scalability and economic sustainability through intelligent multi-tenant architecture design.
