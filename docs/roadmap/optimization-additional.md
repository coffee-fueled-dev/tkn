Category 1: CPU-Bound Optimizations (The Hot Path)

These optimizations target the most computationally intensive parts of the pipeline: hashing and the core mining loop.

1.1. Optimize the TKN Miner's getKey() Method

Opportunity: The TknMiner's createKey method is called for every single new item added to the window. The current implementation uses createHash('sha1') to generate a meta-hash for sequences.

The Problem: sha1 is a cryptographic hash. It's much slower and more computationally expensive than non-cryptographic hashes like cyrb53. You've already optimized the primary data hashing; now you can optimize the internal sequence hashing.

The Solution: Replace the SHA1 meta-hash with another cyrb53 hash. Since the purpose of the key is just to serve as a unique identifier for a sequence in an in-memory map, a fast, non-crypto hash is perfectly suitable. You can create a new cyrb53 function that takes an array of HashedValue buffers and hashes them together.

Generated typescript
// In TknMiner.ts
private createKey(hashes: HashedValue[]): string {
if (hashes.length === 0) return "";
// No need for a cryptographic hash here!
// This is a major CPU bottleneck.
// const hasher = createHash("sha1"); // SLOW

// Instead, use a faster method. You could even implement a
// version of cyrb53 that works on buffers directly.
// For simplicity, let's just combine and re-hash.
const combined = Buffer.concat(hashes);
const keyHash = cyrb53(combined.toString('binary')); // FAST
return Buffer.from(keyHash).toString('base64');
}

Expected Impact: High. This could significantly speed up the core mining loop, as getKey() is on the critical path.

1.2. Optimize Binary Data Hashing in SymbolTable

Opportunity: Your SymbolTable has a getHashForBinary method, but the implementation in the codebase falls back to the standard getHash if the algorithm isn't sha256.

The Problem: The getHash fallback will stringify the Uint8Array, which is highly inefficient. It converts binary data into a string representation, which is then fed to cyrb53.

The Solution: Modify the cyrb53 function or create a variant that can operate directly on a Uint8Array or Buffer without converting it to a string first. The cyrb53 algorithm operates on character codes, so you can adapt it to work with byte values directly.

Generated typescript
// In symbol-table.ts, within hashData
if (data instanceof Uint8Array && this.algorithm === HashAlgorithm.CYRB53) {
// Don't stringify! Create a path to hash bytes directly.
hashArray = cyrb53_from_bytes(data, 0, this.hashSize);
} else {
// The existing string path
const inputStr = //...
hashArray = cyrb53(inputStr, 0, this.hashSize);
}

Expected Impact: High for any workflow that involves sending TYPE_BINARY messages. For text/JSON, this has no impact.

Category 2: I/O-Bound Optimizations (Database Interaction)

This is likely the single biggest area for performance gains, as database operations are almost always slower than in-memory computation.

2.1. Use UNWIND for Batch Database Writes

Opportunity: The SyncStream's processBatch method loops through the token buffer and executes a MERGE query for each pair of tokens inside a single transaction.

The Problem: This is a classic "N+1" query problem. Even within a transaction, making 500 separate calls to the database driver involves significant overhead. The database has to plan and execute 500 small queries.

The Solution: Re-architect the query to use UNWIND. Collect all the token pairs and dictionary entries into lists in your application, then send them to the database in a single query. The database can then un-batch the list and process it much more efficiently.

Current (Slow) Approach:

Generated javascript
for (pair of pairs) {
await tx.run("MERGE (a)-[:REL]->(b)", pair.params);
}

Optimized UNWIND Approach:

Generated javascript
// In your application:
const pairBatch = [
{ tkn1v: 'valA', tkn2v: 'valB', ... },
{ tkn1v: 'valC', tkn2v: 'valD', ... },
// ... 500 pairs
];
const dictBatch = [
{ key: 'k1', value: 'v1' },
// ... all dictionary entries
];

// In a single transaction:
await tx.run(`  // First, process all dictionary entries
  UNWIND $dictBatch as entry
  MERGE (d:ValueDictionary:$tid {key: entry.key})
  ON CREATE SET d.value = entry.value`, { dictBatch, tid: this.tenantId });

await tx.run(`  // Then, process all relationships
  UNWIND $pairBatch as pair
  MERGE (tkn1:Tkn:$tid {value: pair.tkn1v})
  ON CREATE SET tkn1.lookupKeys = pair.tkn1k
  MERGE (tkn2:Tkn:$tid {value: pair.tkn2v})
  ON CREATE SET tkn2.lookupKeys = pair.tkn2k
  MERGE (tkn1)-[:D1 {idx: pair.tkn1idx, session: $sid}]->(tkn2)`, { pairBatch, sid: this.sessionId, tid: this.tenantId });

Expected Impact: Very High. This is the most important optimization you can make. It can reduce the time spent in database transactions by an order of magnitude, dramatically increasing the overall throughput of SyncStream.

Category 3: Architectural & Memory Optimizations
3.1. Encourage and Optimize Client-Side Batching

Opportunity: The TKN protocol supports a TYPE_BATCH message.

The Problem: If clients send many small messages instead of one large batch, the system incurs overhead for every single message (network packets, socket reads, protocol parsing).

The Solution:

Documentation/SDK: Strongly encourage users of your client libraries to use the sendBatch method whenever possible.

Server-Side: Ensure the server's read buffer (socket.data.buffer) is appropriately sized to handle large batches without needing to resize frequently. The current 8K initial buffer is a reasonable start.

Expected Impact: Medium. This reduces network overhead and allows the server to process data in more efficient, larger chunks, reducing the number of times the processing loop is invoked.

Summary of Optimization Opportunities
ID Optimization Area Type Impact
2.1 Batch DB Writes with UNWIND SyncStream I/O Very High
1.1 Use cyrb53 for getKey() meta-hash TknMiner CPU High
1.2 Optimize cyrb53 for Binary Data SymbolTable CPU High (for binary streams)
3.1 Promote Client-Side Batching Protocol/Client Network Medium

Recommendation:

Implement the UNWIND optimization first. It will provide the biggest performance boost to the entire system's throughput.

Implement the getKey() optimization second. This will speed up the core algorithm's CPU-bound work.

Implement the other optimizations as needed, based on profiling and the specific use cases you are targeting.
