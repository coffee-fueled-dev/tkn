## Executive Summary

The TKN (Token) system represents a novel approach to real-time pattern discovery in streaming data. Unlike traditional systems that rely on predefined models or explicit pattern definitions, TKN employs an autonomous pattern mining algorithm that discovers meaningful sequences without prior training or configuration. The recent extension to multi-dimensional processing, particularly for numerical data streams, represents a significant evolution that dramatically expands its capabilities and application domains.

## Core Technology Foundation

At its foundation, TKN employs a lightweight binary protocol and a unique token mining algorithm with these key capabilities:

1. **Autonomous Pattern Discovery**: The system automatically identifies recurring token sequences without explicit pattern definitions or training data.

2. **Streaming-First Architecture**: Built for real-time processing with minimal latency, scaling from edge devices to cloud deployments.

3. **Graph-Based Pattern Storage**: Discovered patterns are stored in a Neo4j/Memgraph database, enabling sophisticated relationship mapping and query capabilities.

4. **Protocol Efficiency**: The binary protocol achieves high throughput with minimal overhead, supporting various data types (JSON, string, binary, and batch processing).

5. **Cross-Platform Support**: Client libraries for both server and browser environments enable consistent application development across the entire stack.

## Multi-Dimensional Pattern Mining Innovation

The new multi-dimensional capabilities represent a fundamental advancement in the system's pattern recognition capabilities, particularly for numerical data:

### Technical Innovation

1. **Dimensional Decomposition**: Numeric values are automatically decomposed into their constituent dimensions (digits, decimal position, etc.), with each dimension processed by dedicated token miners operating in parallel.

2. **Unsupervised Feature Extraction**: The system automatically discovers meta-features from numerical streams using algorithms like Incremental Slow Feature Analysis, without requiring manual feature engineering or domain expertise.

3. **Cross-Dimensional Pattern Discovery**: By maintaining relationships between dimensions in the graph database, the system can identify complex patterns that span multiple dimensions and features.

4. **Temporal Feature Evolution**: By tracking how features themselves change over time, the system can discover higher-order patterns in how data evolves.

5. **Adaptive Memory Management**: Each dimension employs efficient LRU caching to maintain optimal memory usage regardless of stream volume or duration.

## System Architecture

The TKN architecture consists of these key components:

1. **Protocol Layer**: Binary messaging protocol for efficient data transmission with automatic dimensionality handling.

2. **TKN Miners**: Parallel pattern mining engines, one per dimension, that identify novel sequences and manage pattern banks.

3. **Feature Extraction Layer**: Unsupervised algorithms that automatically extract meaningful features from raw dimensional data.

4. **Graph Storage Layer**: Neo4j/Memgraph database with an enhanced schema for dimensional data, enabling sophisticated pattern querying.

5. **Metrics & Monitoring**: Prometheus integration for real-time performance monitoring and operational visibility.

   - Native support for digit-level pattern mining
   - Built-in feature extraction without custom coding
   - Graph-based pattern storage for relationship analysis

## Key Technical Unlocks from Multi-Dimensional Processing

The multi-dimensional extension enables several groundbreaking capabilities:

1. **Scale-Invariant Pattern Discovery**: Can identify similar patterns across different orders of magnitude by processing digit positions independently.

2. **Structural Pattern Recognition**: Detects patterns in the structure of numbers (digit relationships, decimal shifts) independent of absolute values.

3. **Feature-Level Relationship Mining**: Discovers relationships between derived features and original data dimensions that would be invisible to systems operating on raw values.

4. **Cross-Scale Pattern Unification**: Can recognize when patterns at different granularities are manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon.

5. **Time-Scale Invariant Detection**: By analyzing features at multiple time scales simultaneously, can detect similar patterns regardless of their temporal frequency.
