This is a small test file for the TKN file streamer example.
It contains just a few lines of text to demonstrate how the file streaming works.
The TKN client will read this file in small chunks and send them to the server.
Each chunk will be sent as either a string or binary data, depending on configuration.
This allows for testing the different data types supported by the TKN protocol.
